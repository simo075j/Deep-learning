# Deep-learning

This repo consists of a series of projects related to neural networks and deep learning.


The first project revolves around coding neural network structures trough three different approaches.

**1 Using Python base code (no libraries)

**2 Using the Numpy library

**3 Keras Using the Keras/Tensorflow library

This is done to ensure a base understanding of the core concepts in deeplearning
