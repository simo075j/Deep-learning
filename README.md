# Neural networks and Deep-learning

This repo consists of a series of projects related to neural networks and deep learning.

### Project 1 - Neural networks from scratch
The first project revolves around coding neural network structures trough three different approaches.

*1 Using Python base code (no libraries)

*2 Using the Numpy library

*3 Using the Keras/Tensorflow library

This is done to ensure a base understanding of the core concepts in deeplearning


### Project 2 - assignment clasifying newswires / Boston house price (assign. c) / Understanding RNN


### Project 3 - Advanced RNN implementation


### project 4 - covnets? or new repo for image recognition?
