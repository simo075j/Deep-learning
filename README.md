# Neural networks and Deep-learning

This repo consists of a series of projects related to neural networks and deep learning.

### Project 1 - Neural networks from scratch
The first project revolves around coding neural network structures trough three different approaches.

*1 Using Python base code (no libraries)

*2 Using the Numpy library

*3 Using the Keras/Tensorflow library

This is done to ensure a base understanding of the core concepts in deeplearning


### Project 2 - IMDB score classification with NLP and recurrent neural networks (simple RNN and LSTM)
This project utilizes the power of recurrent neural networks on sequential data such as a bag of words.
The implementation is initialized with a simple RNN architechture, which is evaluated and improved significantly by applying a LSTM architechture.
The LSTM recurrent neural network is able to predict the sentiment of reviews with a accuracy of 90% (without any hyperparameter tuning)

### Project 3 - Temperature forecasting and IMDB score classification with advanced recurrent neural networks (bidirectional RNN, Dropout and Network stacking)
The final installment in this series of projects revolves around more advanced uses of recurrent deep neural networks. This approach is applied and evaluated on a weather forecasting problem aswell as a continuation on the IMDB NLP problem.
